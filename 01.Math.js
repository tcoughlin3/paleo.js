 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * */

// The Math object has all sorts of useful functions that JavaScript
// programmers use every day. Functions like `Math.sqrt` (square root)
// or `Math.random` (generates random number). But we're caveman coders
// so we're going to go without, and implement this functions manually.


// Our first function, `Math.floor` rounds a number down to the next
// whole number. To get you in the swing of things, this first one is
// implemented for you.
var floor = function(number) {
  var r = number % 1;
  return number < 0 ? number - (!r ? 0 : 1 + r) : number - r;
};


// `Math.ceiling` also rounds to a whole number, but it rounds up.
var ceiling = function(number) {
	var remainder = number % 1;
	var ceil;
	if (number > 0 && remainder) {
		ceil = number + 1 - remainder;
	} else {
		ceil = number - remainder;
	}
	return ceil;
};


// `Math.abs` returns the absolute value of a number.
var abs = function(number) {

};


// As JavaScript doesn't have an exponent operator, you'll need
// `Math.pow` to raise a number to a power. Too bad you can't use that.
var pow = function(base, exponent) {

};


// `Math.max` is a function that that compares any number of numbers
// and returns the largest. Let's make a version that compares two.
var max = function(x, y) {

};


// I bet you can guess what `Math.min` is suppossed to do. This time,
// use the `arguments` keyword so that we can compare more than two.
var min = function() {

};
